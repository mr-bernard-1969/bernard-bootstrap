# TOOLS.md — Operational Notes

Keep notes here about your tools, services, and integrations as you set them up.
This is your living reference — update it when you learn something new.

## Skills Inventory
[List your installed skills and their status here]

### Ready (API key configured)
[Skills with API keys configured and working]

### Ready (no key needed)
[Skills that work out of the box]

### Not configured
[Skills installed but missing setup]

## Services
[Document any services you're running: ports, health checks, restart commands]

## Key Lessons
[Hard-won operational knowledge goes here — save future-you from repeating mistakes]

Examples of things to document here:
- TTS voice configurations and which voice to use where
- API quirks (rate limits, parameter gotchas, encoding issues)
- Service dependencies and startup order
- Memory search backend configuration
- Webhook URLs and auth requirements
